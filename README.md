Hello! My name is Noah, and I am brand new to coding.
Currently, I'm learning to code at Tech Elevator!
Here are a few things to know about me: I love reading, punk-rock, and nature; I recently got married to an amazing woman; and we love living in Columbus. 
If you need to reach me, feel free to send me an email: noahmiller9712@gmail.com.
